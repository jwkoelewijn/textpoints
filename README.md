# textpoints

A Quil sketch showing a text as points. Points will move to their target location, or flee
from the mouse if the cursor is less than 50px away from it.

## Usage

Run `lein figwheel` in your terminal. Wait for a while until you see `Successfully compiled "resources/public/js/main.js"`. Open [localhost:3449](http://localhost:3449) in your browser.

You can use this while developing your sketch. Whenever you save your source files the browser will automatically refresh everything, providing you with quick feedback. For more information about Figwheel, check the [Figwheel repository on GitHub](https://github.com/bhauman/lein-figwheel).
